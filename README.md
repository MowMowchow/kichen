# Kichen

Kichen is an online marketplace for buying and selling food.

~ Info ~
- Maintained a RESTful API server using Node.js and Express.js to handle CRUD operations
- MongoDB was used to store information regarding food items and user carts
- The front end was done using React
- Cart information was tracked with the user's public IP address to prevent items from being lost when accidentally closing the tab or refreshing the page.

Users may browse listings for foot items that are currently available and add them to their cart.
